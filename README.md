A CKAN extension containinig plugins ``datajson``.
First is used by http://catalog.data.gov/ to harvest data sources 
from a remote /data.json file according to the U.S. Project
Open Data metadata specification (https://project-open-data.cio.gov/).

Plugin ``datajson`` provides a harvester to import datasets from other
remote /data.json files. See below for setup instructions.

And the plugin also provides a new view to validate /data.json files
at http://ckanhostname/pod/validate.

Installation
------------

To install, activate your CKAN virtualenv, install dependencies, and
install the module in develop mode, which just puts the directory in your
Python path.

	. path/to/pyenv/bin/activate
	pip install -r pip-requirements.txt
	python setup.py develop

Then in your CKAN .ini file, add ``datajson``
to your ckan.plugins line:

	ckan.plugins = (other plugins here...) datajson

That's the plugin for /data.json output. To make the harvester available,
also add:

	ckan.plugins = (other plugins here...) harvest datajson_harvest

If you're running CKAN via WSGI, we found a strange Python dependency
bug. It might only affect development environments. The fix was to
revise wsgi.py and add:

	import ckanext

before

	from paste.deploy import loadapp

Then restart your server and check out:

	http://yourdomain.com/data.json
	   and
	http://yourdomain.com/data.jsonld
	   and
	http://yourdomain.com/pod/validate	
	
Caching The Response
--------------------

If you're deploying inside Apache, some caching would be a good idea
because generating the /data.json file can take a good few moments.
Enable the cache modules:

	a2enmod cache
	a2enmod disk_cache

And then in your Apache configuration add:

	CacheEnable disk /data.json
	CacheRoot /tmp/apache_cache
	CacheDefaultExpire 120
	CacheMaxFileSize 50000000
	CacheIgnoreCacheControl On
	CacheIgnoreNoLastMod On
	CacheStoreNoStore On

And be sure to create /tmp/apache_cache and make it writable by the Apache process.

Generating /data.json Off-Line
------------------------------

Generating this file is a little slow, so an alternative instead of caching is
to generate the file periodically (e.g. in a cron job). In that case, you'll want
to change the path that CKAN generates the file at to something *other* than /data.json.
In your CKAN .ini file, in the app:main section, add:

	ckanext.datajson.path = /internal/data.json

Now create a crontab file ("mycrontab") to download this URL to a file on disk
every ten minutes:

	0-59/10 * * * * wget -qO /path/to/static/data.json http://localhost/internal/data.json

And activate your crontab like so:

	crontab mycrontab

In Apache, we'll want to block outside access to the "internal" URL, and also
map the URL /data.json to the static file. In your httpd.conf, add:

	Alias /data.json /path/to/static/data.json
	
	<Location /internal/>
		Order deny,allow
		Allow from 127.0.0.1
		Deny from all
	</Location>

And then restart Apache. Wait for the cron job to run once, then check if
/data.json loads (and it should be fast!). Also double check that 
http://yourdomain.com/internal/data.json gives a 403 forbidden error when
accessed from some other location.

Options
-------

You can customize the URL that generates the data.json output:

	ckanext.datajson.path = /data.json
	ckanext.datajsonld.path = /data.jsonld
	ckanext.datajsonld.id = http://www.youragency.gov/data.json

You can enable or disable the Data.json output by setting

    ckanext.datajson.url_enabled = False

If ckanext.datajsonld.path is omitted, it defaults to replacing ".json" in your
ckanext.datajson.path path with ".jsonld", so it probably won't need to be
specified.

The option ckanext.datajsonld.id is the @id value used to identify the data
catalog itself. If not given, it defaults to ckan.site_url.

The Harvester
-------------

To use the data.json harvester, you'll also need to set up the CKAN harvester
extension. See the CKAN harvester README at https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-harvest
for how to do that. You'll set some configuration variables and then initialize the
CKAN harvester plugin using:

	paster --plugin=ckanext-harvest harvester initdb --config=/path/to/ckan.ini

Now you can set up a new DataJson harvester by visiting:

	http://yourdomain.com/harvest

And when configuring the data source, just choose "/data.json" as the source type.

**The next paragraph assumes you're using my fork of the CKAN harvest extension
at https://github.com/JoshData/ckanext-harvest**

In the configuration field, you can put a YAML string containing defaults for fields
that may not be set in the source data.json files, e.g. enter something like this:

	defaults:
	  Agency: Department of Health & Human Services
	  Author: Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration
	  author_id: http://healthdata.gov/id/agency/samhsa

This again is tied to the HealthData.gov metadata schema.
